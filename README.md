# Aircraft Checklist Database Builder (ACDB)
I wrote **ACDB** to help users create interactive TTS checklists for [Lorby Axis and Ohs](https://axisandohs.weebly.com/). The program collects information from the user that it uses to write special RPN scripts that Axis and Ohs can run as if it is reading off a checklist and waiting for confirmation that each item is completed. **ACDB** greatly simplifies the process and makes it possible for the user to easily edit the scripts, if he desire to make a change in the checklists.

**ACDB** saves the data given for a specific aircraft in a text file containing JSON data. And once all of the data has been entered for all of an aircraft's checklists, the program can build the scripts necessary to have Axis and Ohs read the checklists off to a pilot.

For information on running the scripts in Axis and Ohs see the section "19. Interactive TextToSpeech Checklist" on page 93 of [Lorby "Axis and Ohs" for Microsoft Flight Simulator Documentation](https://axisandohs.weebly.com/uploads/6/0/8/2/60827113/lorbyaxisandohs_msfs_documentation.pdf). The documentation is written for Microsoft Flight Simulator, but the instructions regarding the use of scripts should work with any simulator.

You will find instructions for installing and using **ACDB** under the Wiki tab above.
